# I am beginning with my extension because I put all of the authors' figures in the appendix.
# The purpose of this article is to examine how elements of a violent act cause people to respond. 
# Because the data includes some demographic information about the respondents, I want to look at how
# elements of a person prompt them to respond in certain ways to violent acts. 


# In the author's main analysis code, they change the response weighting variable to be numeric. 
# I figured since I want to run a regression for my extension that it would make sense to do the same 
# for the variables of interest. 

as.numeric(dat2$Education)
as.numeric(dat2$Ideorate)

  

# In particular, I want to look at ideology and education. 
# I run regressions with the terror binary (1 = Yes, terrorism, 0 = No, not terrrorism) as the 
# dependent variable using ideology rating (1-7: extremely conservative-extremely liberal)
# and education (1-8: least to most educated) in separate models. 
# The goal of these models are twofold: 1. show which categories for each characteristic are significant
# predictors of classifying events as terrorism or not and 2. provide a basis for which I can derive
# probabilities that each group will define an event as terrorism. 

ideo_reg <- glm(TerrorBinary ~ Ideorate, data = dat2)
summary(ideo_reg)

education_reg <- glm(TerrorBinary ~ Education, data = dat2)

# I found this function/step by step process at https://sebastiansauer.github.io/convert_logit2prob/.
# Very helpful resource!!

logit2prob <-function(logit){
  odds <- exp(logit)
  prob <- odds/(1 + odds)
  return(prob)
}

# Once the function is created, I know plug in the models, which now "de-logarithmizes," converts to odds, then converts to probability. (Again, gathered that information from the source above).
# These probabilities basically back up what the regression coefficients show.

# In the actual paper I show the regression table outputs. I want to find a good way to visualize
# the probabilities if possible.

# I struggled with deciding how I wanted to present my results. 
# One major issue I'm having is that it seems that one entire category either disappears or becomes
# the constant value in the regression's output? Not sure how to fix this, but it initially threw
# off my labeling. Renamed constant to correspond with the ideology coded as 1.

```

# Changed the constant in the same fashion. In the final results, I want to try the dummy variable

stargazer(ideo_reg,header = FALSE, covariate.labels = c("Conservative", "Slightly conservative", "Moderate", "Slightly liberal", "Liberal", "Extremely liberal", "Extremely conservative"), dep.var.labels = c("Terror Binary"), title = "Political Ideology")

# Note: My idea for fixing the issue with the 1s in the table is to separate each response and to
# create dummy variables for each before running the regression. I sort of played around with 
# this but I could not figure out how to properly do it/don't know if that would even make a difference.
# Food for thought!

# Appendix

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# In terms of replicating Huff and Kertzer's work, I did pretty much all of the figures and table 2. 
# I intentionally did not replicate Figure 1, Table 1, or Figure 7. 
# Figure 1 is simply an example vignette with a description of the type of scenario a 
# respondent would be presented with (I could type this up myself if need be).
# Table 1 lists the conjoint treatments by category (the characteristics that are being manipulated;
# also could just type this up if needed). 
# Finally, Figure 7 is a part of the author's applications. Initially I did not intend to replicate 
# any figures in the application section. However, Table 2 deals with the probability of classification
# which I am interested in for my extension. Figure 7, on the other hand, deals with the impact of media
# reporting, which is not as directly related to my extension. 

# Notes: The following code replicates most figures and table 2. Need some revisions for
# formatting once it is knitted, especially in the appendix figures.

# At first, this code chunk was giving me a lot of issues, and I tried to comment it out.
# But, plotmat2 is necessary for a lot of the figure replication down the road.
# I think system.time a few lines down just makes it long/hard to run at first.
