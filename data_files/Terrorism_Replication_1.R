#How the Public Defines Terrorism Replication Code
#Connor Huff & Josh Kertzer
#Last modified: June 1, 2017

## This R file contains the code necessary to replicate the analysis in the main text Its companion R file ("Terrorism_Replication_2.R") replicates the analysis in the appendix.
# All of the following analyses were carried out using R version 3.1.1 on a 2.5 GHz Intel Core i5 iMac running OS X El Capitan 10.11.6


##The script which follows is comprised of two components. Component 1 will read in the survey data from qualtrics and then clean the data to prepare for analyses. Component 2 will replicate the analyses in the main text. 
#To save time in replicating, if you don't want to build the dataframe yourself, you can start on line 603, which loads "Terrorism.RDATA"
