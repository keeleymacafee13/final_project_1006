Terrorism.RData — a cleaned RData object which will be used for the analysis in the manuscript and supplementary appendix. 

pred.RData — a RData object used in the Appendix comprised of the predicted potential outcomes.

SVM Weighted.RDATA  — RData object which is used for Table 2. Provides coefficient estimates with survey weights from most predictive model (from Imai and Ratkovic 2013). 

SVM.RData — RData object which is used for Table 2. Provides coefficient estimates without survey weights from most predictive model (from Imai and Ratkovic 2013).

full.RData —  RData object used in the Appendix which is comprised of the full factorial design matrix. 

Terror_Classifications.csv — the CSV which contains the list of 39 real world incidents and the codings we used to classify each incident. This CSV is necessary to reproduce Table 2 in the main text.

Terrorism_Replication_1.R — replicates all of the analysis in the main text. Note: because of terms of use agreements, in order to replicate Figure 7, users should first download the news articles directly from Lexis Nexis.

Terrorism_Replication_2.R — replicates all of the analysis in the the supplementary appendix.

LexNex_Year.csv — a CSV which contains daily counts from Lexis Nexis of mentions of “terrorism” in the year surrounding the experiment. 

US Search Trends Jan 2015-Jan 2016.csv — a CSV which contains daily counts from google analytics of mentions of “terrorism” in the year surrounding the experiment.
